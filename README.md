Remote IPython Notebook
===============

This package will launch a PBS job and a remote **IPython notebook** on the JANUS supercomputer. The package is installed locally and nothing needs to be setup on the remote connection.  Instead, *remotenb* uses the [*paramiko*](http://www.lag.net/paramiko/) to move files and execute commands.

- **Linux** and **OSX only**
